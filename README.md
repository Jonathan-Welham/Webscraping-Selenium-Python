# Webscraping-Selenium-Python
This was my first time using selenium. I have to say it wasn't hard at all to set it up. The only obstacle I had was an issue with using findElementsbyId or ...byName. For some reason it couldn't find name or id. My solution to this was to use findbyXPath; this seems to work in all cases.
